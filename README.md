Multi-Dimensional Engine

16 year old me made this.

Like any flexible engine, it only renders a hyper-cube, or any cube in higher dimension choosen by user and doesn't render anything else. It is entirely implemented in software and doesn't use the GPU (apart from the browser's canvas API internal implementation).
